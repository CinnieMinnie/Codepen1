  <h2 id="headline"> Here's a timeline of Jacinda Adern's life:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1980</strong> - Born in Hamilton, New Zealand</li>
    <li><strong>1997</strong> - She joined the Labour Party at the age of 17</li>
    <li><strong>2001</strong> - She graduated from the University of Waikatu with a Bachelors in Communication Studies in politics and public</li>
    <li><strong>2008</strong> - Ardern was elected as the president of the International Union of Socialist Youth</li>
    <li><strong>2010</strong> - She was ranked 20th on Labour's party list. This was a very high placement for someone who was not already a sitting MP, and virtually assured her of a seat in Parliament.</li>
    <li><strong>2017</strong> - Ardern put forward her name for the Labour nomination for the Mount Albert by-election to be held in February 2017[37] following the resignation of David Shearer on 8 December 2016. When nominations for the Labour Party closed on 12 January 2017, Ardern was the only nominee and was selected unopposed.</li>
    <li><strong>1st of January 2017</strong> - Just seven weeks before the 2017 general election, she assumed the position of leader of the Labour Party, and consequently became leader of the Opposition, following the resignation of Andrew Little. At 37, Ardern became the youngest leader of the Labour Party in its history.</li>
    <li><strong>July 2018</strong> - Ardern announced the start of her government's flagship Families Package. Among its provisions, the package gradually increased paid parental leave to 26 weeks and paid $60-a-week to low and middle-income families with young children</li>
    <li><strong>January 2018</strong>- The first year of post-secondary education was made free and, after industrial action, the government agreed to increase primary teachers' pay by 12.8 (for beginning teachers) and 18.5 per cent (for senior teachers without other responsibilities) by 2021</li>
    <li><strong>15th of March 2018</strong> - 51 people were fatally shot and 49 injured in two mosques in Christchurch. Less than one month after the attack, the New Zealand Parliament passed a law that bans most semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles, parts that convert guns into semiautomatic guns, and higher capacity magazines. Ardern received international praise for her response to the shootings.</li>
    <li><strong>March 2020</strong> - After the outbreak of Covid-19, National and international media covered the government response led by Ardern, praising her leadership and swift response to the outbreak in New Zealand. Post-lockdown opinion polls showed the Labour Party with nearly 60 per cent support.[158][159] In May 2020, Ardern rated 59.5 per cent as 'preferred prime minister' in a Newshub Reid Research poll—the highest score for any leader in the Reid Research poll's history</li>
